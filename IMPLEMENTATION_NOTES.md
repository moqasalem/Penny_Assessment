## 1. What I changed

<!-- A short summary of the changes you made, ideally grouped by task. What bugs did you fix, what did you
implement, and why? -->

- Fix: rounds fractional line totals to the nearest cent (not truncating)
- Fix: rejects an illegal transition DRAFT -> APPROVED (must go through approval)
- Fix: missing transitions in LEGAL_TRANSITIONS array
- Implement CR workflow actions: sendForApproval, approve, returnToDraft, reject, and apply.
- Implement committee routing and voting workflow
- feat: enforce CR permissions and read scopes

## 2. Domain model

<!-- Describe the domain in your own words: the entities, the state machine, and how transitions are
guarded. A small diagram or table is welcome. -->

-

## 3. Invariants I enforce (and how)

<!-- Which properties your implementation guarantees, and where in the code each one is enforced. -->

| Invariant | How it's enforced | Where (file / function) |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
|           |                   |                         |

## 4. Testing strategy

<!-- What did you test and why? What did you deliberately NOT test, and why was that a reasonable cut
given the time budget? -->

-

## 5. Assumptions

<!-- The rules leave some things open to interpretation. Where you had to make a judgment call, state the
decision you made and the reasoning behind it. -->

-

## 6. Where I used AI

<!-- Allowed and expected. Briefly: what you used it for, and how you verified the output. No transcripts
needed. -->

-

## 7. What I'd improve with more time

<!-- The riskiest part of your solution, known limitations, and what you'd do next. -->
